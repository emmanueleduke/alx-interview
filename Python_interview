You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

code snippet 

def licenseKeyFormatting(s, k):
    # Remove dashes and convert to uppercase
    s = s.replace("-", "").upper()

    # Calculate the length of the first group
    first_group_len = len(s) % k

    # Initialize the result with the first group
    result = s[:first_group_len]

    # Add dashes and remaining groups
    for i in range(first_group_len, len(s), k):
        if i != 0:
            result += "-"
        result += s[i:i + k]

    return result

# Example usage:
s = "2-4A0r7-4k"
k = 4
formatted_license = licenseKeyFormatting(s, k)
print(formatted_license)
